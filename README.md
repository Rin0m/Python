# Python Projects 

This repository contains various Python scripts and mini-projects ranging from graphical programs to utilities with graphical user interfaces. Each file is described below:

## Files Overview

### 1. `Deutschepflage.py`
- **Description:** Draws the German national flag using the `turtle` graphics library.
- **How it works:** The script creates three colored rectangles (black, red, yellow) to represent the flag, and keeps the window open to display the result.

### 2. `Ein-Auschecken.py`
- **Description:** A GUI application for time tracking (check-in/check-out) using `tkinter`.
- **How it works:** Users can enter their name, and their check-in/check-out times are logged to a CSV file named `arbeitszeiten.csv`. The app provides feedback via popup messages.

### 3. `Geometrie Schönheit.py`
- **Description:** Generates a colorful, hypnotic geometric pattern using `turtle` and `colorsys`.
- **How it works:** The script draws repeated circles and lines with changing colors, resulting in an artistic animation on a black background.

### 4. `ProCalculator.py`
- **Description:** An advanced calculator app with a graphical interface using `tkinter`.
- **How it works:** Features a calculator GUI with number and operator buttons, live result display, and error handling. Supports basic arithmetic operations.

### 5. `calculator.py`
- **Description:** A simple command-line calculator.
- **How it works:** Prompts the user to enter an operator and two numbers, then prints the result. Handles division by zero and invalid operators.

## Getting Started

- Most scripts require Python 3.
- For GUI-based applications (`Ein-Auschecken.py`, `ProCalculator.py`), you need `tkinter` (usually bundled with Python).
- For graphical scripts (`Deutschepflage.py`, `Geometrie Schönheit.py`), you need the `turtle` library (also standard with Python).

## Usage

Run any script using:
```bash
python <scriptname.py>
```
Follow on-screen instructions or interact with the GUI as prompted.
